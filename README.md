# ECE484_S24_Final-Individual-Project
This repository consists of Arduino .ino files that are my personal contribution to our group pinball development project for ECE484. My role consists of managing the scoring system for our game, of which is influenced by time spent playing, obstacles struck and how many times, the like. A video demo implementing this project can be found at this link: https://youtu.be/O8-SDnDbmb4?si=zv4rdaSFbvIvSkDM
